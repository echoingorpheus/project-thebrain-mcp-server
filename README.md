### Summary

The TheBrain MCP Server is a Ruby implementation of a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that bridges AI assistants with TheBrain's knowledge management system. This innovative project transforms TheBrain from a passive knowledge repository into an active, AI-accessible knowledge assistant that can "think with you" rather than just store information.

TheBrain is a powerful visual knowledge management platform trusted by major organizations including Boeing, Microsoft, Google, Apple, and Harvard University. It enables users to create dynamic, interconnected networks of thoughts, files, and ideas that mirror natural thinking patterns. The MCP Server project extends TheBrain's capabilities by providing AI assistants like Claude Desktop, VS Code, and other MCP clients with seamless access to your personal knowledge base through standardized tools and resources.

This project represents a significant step forward in making personal knowledge management systems truly intelligent and interactive. By implementing the Model Context Protocol specification, it enables bidirectional communication between AI models and TheBrain, allowing for sophisticated operations like semantic search, thought creation, relationship management, and content analysis. The server's modular Ruby architecture ensures reliability, performance, and extensibility while maintaining the security and privacy standards expected for personal knowledge management systems.

### Architecture

The TheBrain MCP Server implements a sophisticated multi-layered architecture that seamlessly connects AI assistants with TheBrain's knowledge management ecosystem through the standardized Model Context Protocol.

#### Key Concepts

* **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: An open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs, enabling AI assistants to access external data sources and tools through a unified interface
* **TheBrain**: A visual knowledge management platform that enables users to create dynamic, interconnected networks of thoughts, files, and ideas that mirror natural thinking patterns
* **Thought Networks**: The core organizational structure in TheBrain where individual thoughts (concepts, ideas, files) are connected through meaningful relationships and associations
* **JSON-RPC 2.0**: The communication protocol used by MCP for message exchange between clients and servers, providing standardized request-response patterns
* **Tool Handlers**: Specialized Ruby methods that implement specific MCP tools (search, create, update, delete) and translate them into TheBrain API operations
* **Resource Interface**: MCP's mechanism for exposing TheBrain thoughts as accessible resources with standardized URIs and content formatting
* **Bearer Token Authentication**: Security mechanism used to authenticate with TheBrain's REST API using API keys for secure access to personal knowledge bases
* **Concurrent Caching**: In-memory caching system using Ruby's concurrent-ruby gem to optimize API performance and reduce redundant requests to TheBrain
* **Stdio Transport**: The communication channel used by MCP clients to interact with the server through standard input/output streams
* **Thought Relationships**: The parent-child and associative connections between thoughts in TheBrain that create the knowledge network structure

ruby bin/thebrain-mcp-server --test

# Run the test suite to verify everything works
bundle exec rspec
```

### Usage Examples

#### Basic MCP Client Configuration

Configure your MCP client (such as Claude Desktop) to use the TheBrain MCP Server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "thebrain-ruby": {
      "command": "ruby",
      "args": ["/path/to/thebrain-mcp-server-ruby/bin/thebrain-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "THEBRAIN_API_KEY": "your_api_key",
        "THEBRAIN_BRAIN_ID": "your_brain_id"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Tool Usage Examples

**1. Search for thoughts:**
```bash
# Example MCP tool call from an AI assistant
{
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "search_thoughts",
    "arguments": {
      "query": "artificial intelligence",
      "limit": 5
    }
  }
}
```

**2. Retrieve a specific thought:**
```bash
# Get detailed information about a thought
{
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "get_thought",
    "arguments": {
      "thought_id": "12345-abcde-67890"
    }
  }
}
```

**3. Create a new thought:**
```bash
# Create a new thought with notes
{
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "create_thought",
    "arguments": {
      "name": "Machine Learning Concepts",
      "notes": "Core concepts in ML including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.",
      "parent_id": "ai-parent-thought-id"
    }
  }
}
```

**4. Update an existing thought:**
```bash
# Update thought content
{
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "update_thought",
    "arguments": {
      "thought_id": "12345-abcde-67890",
      "notes": "Updated notes with new insights about neural networks."
    }
  }
}
```

#### Resource Access Examples

**Access thoughts as MCP resources:**
```bash
# List available thought resources
{
  "method": "resources/list"
}

# Read specific thought resource
{
  "method": "resources/read",
  "params": {
    "uri": "thebrain://thought/12345-abcde-67890"
  }
}
```

#### Programming API Examples

**Using the TheBrain client directly in Ruby:**
```ruby
require 'thebrain_mcp_server'

# Initialize client
client = ThebrainMcpServer::ThebrainClient.new(
  base_url: 'https://api.thebrain.com',
  api_key: ENV['THEBRAIN_API_KEY'],
  brain_id: ENV['THEBRAIN_BRAIN_ID']
)

# Search for thoughts
results = client.search_thoughts('project ideas', limit: 10)
puts "Found #{results.length} thoughts"

# Create a new thought
new_thought = client.create_thought(
  name: 'Ruby MCP Integration',
  notes: 'Implementation details for MCP server'
)

# Get thought details
thought = client.get_thought(new_thought['id'])
puts "Thought: #{thought['name']}"
puts "Notes: #{thought['notes']}"
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

**1. Authentication Errors**

*Problem*: `401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden` responses from TheBrain API

*Solutions*:
- Verify your API key is correct and hasn't expired
- Check that your Brain ID matches your TheBrain account
- Ensure your TheBrain account has API access enabled (may require Pro/Team subscription)
- Test API credentials directly with curl:
  ```bash
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
       "https://api.thebrain.com/v1/brains/YOUR_BRAIN_ID/thoughts"
  ```

**2. Connection Issues**

*Problem*: Network timeouts or connection refused errors

*Solutions*:
- Check your internet connection and firewall settings
- Verify TheBrain API service status
- Increase timeout values in your `.env` file:
  ```env
  TIMEOUT=60
  ```
- Test connectivity:
  ```bash
  curl -I https://api.thebrain.com
  ```

**3. Installation Problems**

*Problem*: Bundle install fails or gem conflicts

*Solutions*:
- Ensure Ruby 3.1+ is installed: `ruby --version`
- Update bundler: `gem install bundler`
- Clear gem cache: `bundle exec gem cleanup`
- Try fresh bundle install:
  ```bash
  rm Gemfile.lock
  bundle install
  ```

**4. MCP Client Integration Issues**

*Problem*: Claude Desktop or other MCP clients can't connect to server

*Solutions*:
- Verify the server path in MCP client configuration
- Check that Ruby is in your system PATH
- Test server manually:
  ```bash
  echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{}}' | ruby bin/thebrain-mcp-server
  ```
- Review MCP client logs for specific error messages

**5. Runtime Errors**

*Problem*: Server crashes or unexpected behavior

*Solutions*:
- Enable debug logging:
  ```env
  LOG_LEVEL=debug
  ```
- Check server logs for stack traces
- Verify environment variables are properly set
- Test with minimal configuration

#### Debug Mode

Enable comprehensive debugging:

```bash
# Set debug environment
export LOG_LEVEL=debug
export THEBRAIN_DEBUG=true

# Run server with verbose output
ruby bin/thebrain-mcp-server --debug
```
